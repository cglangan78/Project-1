Project 1: Mancala

A recreation of the board game "Mancala." 

Objective: Capture more stones than your opponent. 

Rules:
  1. Player One's wells are on the bottom and their goal is on the right
  2. Player Two's wells are on the top and their goal is on the left
  3. The highlighted wells indicate which playerâ€™s turn it is
  4. Players choose a well from their side of the board and move counterclockwise around the board, placing one stone in every       well they pass (including their own goal but not their opponents)
  5. If a player has enough stones to pass the other player's goal, they place two stones in the well that immediately precedes      the other players goal
  6. The game stops when a player has emptied every well on their side of the board
  7. The player who emptied their wells first then collects the remaining stones on the board and adds them to their goal
  8. The stones in each player well is counted and the player with the most stones in the end wins
